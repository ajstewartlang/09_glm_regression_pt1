# Overview

First off I'd like you to watch the following video which provides an introduction to regression, revises the basics of correlation, before examining how we build a regression model in R using the `lm()` function, test our model assumptions, and interpret the output.

# Packages We Need

First we need to install the packages we need.  We're going to install the `tidyverse` packages plus a few others. The package `Hmisc` allows us to use the `rcorr()` function for calculating Pearson's r, and the `Performance` package so we can test our model assumptions.  Remember, if you haven't previously installed these packages on your laptop you first need to type `install.packages("packagename")` in the console before you can call the `library()` function for that package.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(Hmisc)
library(performance)
```

Import the dataset called `crime_dataset.csv` - this dataset contains population data, housing price index data and crime data for cities in the US.

We can use the function `head()` to display the first few rows of our dataset called "crime".

```{r, message=FALSE}
crime <- read_csv("../data/crime_dataset.csv")
head(crime)
```
